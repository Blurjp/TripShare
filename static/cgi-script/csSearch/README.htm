<b>Installation:<br>
</b>Unzip the csSearch zip file on your computer. Open csSearch.cgi in any
ascii text editor and verify the path to perl is correct on the first line of
the script. If you are not sure what your path to perl is, then leave it alone..
chances are its okay. Transfer the files and directories to the root of your web
site retaining the directory structure in the zip file. For example, you should
have the following directory structure:
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">/cgi-script &lt;-- cgiscript.net script directory<br>
/cgi-script/csSearch &lt;-- csSearch directory<br>
/cgi-script/csSearch/images &lt;-- image directory for script.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">CHMOD csSearch.cgi to 755. When this is
complete, open csSearch.cgi in your webbrowser. Example:
<a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-script/csSearchPro/csSearchPro.cgi">
http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-script/csSearch/csSearch.cgi</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">If all goes well, this will automatically
configure the script and show you a setup page and the remaining installation
instructions.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">If you click 'save' and you come back to the
setup page, then your server doesn't have write access to your directories. You
can solve this problem by chmod'ing the csSearch directory to 777.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<font face="tahoma" size="2">
<p><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Definitions</font></b></font><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
in the setup.cgi file:</font></b></p>
<font face="tahoma" size="2">
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">$cgiurl = Full URL to </font></font>
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">the csSearch directory<font face="tahoma" size="2"><br>
$cgipath = Full PATH to the </font></font> <font face="tahoma" size="2">csSearch</font>
<font face="Tahoma" size="2"> directory.<br>
$rooturl = URL to your website<br>
$rootpath = Full PATH to your document root<br>
$username = username to enter management screens<br>
$password = password to enter management screens</font> </p>
<p><font face="tahoma" size="2">The $rootpath and $rooturl must point to the
same directory on your server and is the point where the searching starts. For
normal operations, this would be the root directory of your website.</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><font face="tahoma" size="2">
</p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Normal Installation Instructions:<br>
</b>In most cases, the script</font></font> will be
auto configured when you first open csSearch.cgi in your browser<font face="tahoma" size="2">.
Change the $username and $password variables to your liking and click 'Save'. If
the setup portion of the script cannot find your site variables automatically,
you </font>will<font face="tahoma" size="2"> have to enter those in the text
area.</font> If you click 'save' and you come back to the setup page, then your
server doesn't have write access to your directories. You can solve this problem
by chmod'ing the csSearch directory to 777.</p>
<p><b>WinNT installations:</b><br>
The script has been tested and works on an NT IIS webserver. You will, however,
have to manually enter the cgipath and rootpath variables. For example, your
rootpath might look something like 'c:/inetpub/wwwroot' (Note: the back-slashes
'\' normally associated with Window's file paths has been changed to a
forward-slash '/'). Also, in csSearch.cgi there is a variable at the top called
$basepath.. change this to match the full path to the csSearch directory.</p>
<font face="tahoma" size="2">
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>CGI-BIN Installation Instructions:<br>
</b></font>
</font>
The preferred method is to install csSearch in a directory outside your
cgi-bin directory as described above, however, i<font face="tahoma" size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">f
your hosting service <b>will not</b> let you run scripts outside your <b>cgi-bin</b>
directory, then follow these procedures:</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Copy all the *.cgi files to a directory in your
cgi-bin directory, making sure they are chmod'd to 755. For example, you could
create a /cgi-bin/</font></font>csSearch<font face="tahoma" size="2">/ directory and place
</font>
</font>

<font face="tahoma" size="2">csSearch</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><font face="tahoma" size="2">.cgi, libs.cgi,
and setup.cgi </font>(<font face="tahoma" size="2">if this file exists</font>)
in this direcory<font face="tahoma" size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Create a directory outside your cgi-bin
directory and copy all the remaining files and subdirectories there. For
example, you could create a /cgi-script/</font></font>csSearch<font face="tahoma" size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"> and place the files there.</font></p>
</font>
<p>Manually configure setup.cgi to the following:<br>
$cgiurl = URL to the csSearch directory INSIDE your cgi-bin directory (where
the script is installed).<br>
$cgipath = FULL PATH to the csSearch directory INSIDE your cgi-bin directory
(where the script is installed).<br>
<i><b>ADD THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES TO THE ABOVE CONFIGURATION OR MANUALLY EDIT
setup.cgi:<br>
</b></i>$htmlurl =&nbsp; FULL URL to the csSearch directory OUTSIDE your cgi-bin
directory (where the remainin<font face="Tahoma" size="2">g files where
installed) <br>
$htmlpath = FULL PATH to the csSearch directory OUTSIDE your cgi-bin
directory (where the remaining</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><font face="tahoma" size="2">
files where installed) <br>
For Example, your new setup.cgi file might look something like this:<br>
$cgiurl='http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-bin/</font></font>csSearch<font face="Tahoma" size="2"><font face="tahoma" size="2">';<br>
$cgipath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-bin/</font></font>csSearch<font face="Tahoma" size="2"><font face="tahoma" size="2">';<br>
$htmlurl='http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/</font></font>csSearch<font face="Tahoma" size="2"><font face="tahoma" size="2">';<br>
$htmlpath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/</font></font>csSearch<font face="tahoma" size="2"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">';<br>
$rootpath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net';<br>
$rooturl='http://www.cgiscript.net';<br>
$username='myusername';<br>
$password=',mypassword';<br>
1;</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i>(note: the '1' at the end is to prevent
errors from perl if $password was left empty)</i></font></p>
</font>
<p><b>Instructions:<br>
</b>Once the script has been setup, you need to go in and configure the searching
parameters. To get to the login screen, open csSearch.cgi in browser with
?command=manage at the end of the URL. Example:<br>
http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-script/csSearch/csSearch.cgi?command=manage<br>
enter the login and password you configured the script with to enter.</p>
<p>This will bring up a screen that has your site's directory contents. To skip
or ignore certain files or directories, click the appropriate button next to the
listing. To skip or ignore multiple files or directories, check the box next to
the name and click the appropriate button at the bottom of the management page.
To un-skip or un-ignore files or directories, repeat the procedure when you
originally skipped or ignored the files. This will act as a toggle for skipping
and ignoring.</p>
<p>'<b>Skip</b>' will only 'skip' this instance of file or directory in a
search.<br>
'<b>Ignore</b>' will 'ignore' all instances of that file or directory name. For
example, if you are ignoring a directory named 'images'.. all directories on the
server named 'images' will be ignored in searching.</p>
<p>Click the 'Advanced Settings' button to enter the advanced settings section.
Read the options on this page carefully. Instructions are next to each item.</p>
<p><b>A word about 'use index':<br>
</b><font color="#FF0000"><b>(ONLY AVAILABLE IN csSearchPro)</b></font><br>
Indexing will greatly improve the speed and efficiency of your searches. If you
select this item, you must click the 'reindex now' button to create the index.
Also, if you have made any chances in the search options such as excluding
&lt;title&gt; tags or parsing for server side includes, you must save these changes
and then go back and reindex to have the changes take affect. Also, if you make
any significant changes on your website, you will want to go back into the
advanced settings area and reindex the site to reflect the changes as far as a
search is concerned.</p>
<p><b>Adding a search form to your page (or anyone else's website):<br>
</b>There are 2 ways to place the search form on your web page. On the management
screen in the advanced section, you will see text areas that contain links to
the search form. You will also see 3 different search form styles you can select
from. Select any of these styles by clicking the appropriate radio button (don't
forget to save your changes). Then copy/paste the Javascript code where you want
the form to appear on your page. This technique uses javascript. If you want to
use SSI (server side includes), take the direct URL to csSearch and remove
your domain. Enter this code on your page: &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;/cgi-script/csSearch/csSearch.cgi--&gt;
. Make sure the path to your installation of csSearch is correct. The
javascript technique would be the preferred technique since you don't have to
have server side includes to be running on your server. Also, you can call the
javascript code from any page or domain. You can offer clients or affiliates the
ability to put a search field on their web page to search your site.</p>
